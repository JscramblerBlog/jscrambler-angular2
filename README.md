## Angular 2 Series
This is the code for three Angular 2 tutorials for jscrambler.com. To get the code for each example, you need to clone the repository, and then checkout to the correct branch. To do this, you can run the following command.

```bash
#clone our source code 
$~ git clone https://github.com/thomasjosephgreco/jscrambler-angular2
#change into the correct directory
$~ cd jscrambler-angular2
# checkout to specified code 
$~/jscrambler-angular2 git checkout <branch-name>
``` 

To run the code, navigate to the directory where your code lies and use the [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) NPM module (or any other tool for running a browser).

```bash
# run http-server inside jscrambler-angular2 director with no caching
$~/jscrambler-angular2 http-server -c-1
```
